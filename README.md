To expand your variometer project to include a display for temperature, humidity, velocity, and a clock, along with saving all data to a micro SD card, you'll need a few more components and some additional coding. Let's break down these enhancements:

### Step 1: Additional Components
- **OLED Display:** This will be used to show temperature, humidity, velocity, a timer with a clock, and other data.
- **DHT22 Sensor:** For measuring temperature and humidity.
- **Micro SD Card Module:** To log data onto a micro SD card.
- **Real-Time Clock (RTC) Module:** Such as the DS3231, for keeping track of the time even when the Pico is powered off.

### Step 2: Hardware Assembly
1. **Connect the DHT22 Sensor:**
   - VCC to 3.3V on the Pico.
   - GND to a GND pin.
   - Data pin to a GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO2).

2. **Connect the OLED Display (assuming I2C communication):**
   - VCC to 3.3V.
   - GND to GND.
   - SCL to GPIO3.
   - SDA to GPIO4.

3. **Connect the Micro SD Card Module:**
   - VCC to 3.3V.
   - GND to GND.
   - MISO to GPIO16.
   - MOSI to GPIO19.
   - SCK to GPIO18.
   - CS to GPIO17.

4. **Connect the RTC Module:**
   - VCC to 3.3V.
   - GND to GND.
   - SCL to another available I2C SCL pin.
   - SDA to another available I2C SDA pin.

### Step 3: Software Setup and Programming
1. **Initialize All Components:**
   - Import necessary libraries and set up each component.
   - Set up I2C for both the OLED and RTC modules.
   - Set up SPI for the SD card module.
   - Set up the DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity readings.

2. **Display Updates and Data Logging:**
   - Create functions to read from each sensor.
   - Update the display with the current data.
   - Log data with timestamps to the SD card.
   - Ensure that you handle file operations properly to avoid data corruption.

3. **Sample Code Snippets:**
   ```python
   from machine import Pin, I2C, SPI, PWM, RTC
   import sdcard, os
   import ssd1306  # For the OLED display
   import dht  # For the DHT22 sensor

   # Initialize sensors and display
   i2c = I2C(0, scl=Pin(3), sda=Pin(4))
   rtc = machine.RTC()
   dht_sensor = dht.DHT22(Pin(2))
   oled = ssd1306.SSD1306_I2C(128, 64, i2c)

   # SPI setup for SD card
   spi = SPI(0, baudrate=5000000, sck=Pin(18), mosi=Pin(19), miso=Pin(16))
   sd = sdcard.SDCard(spi, Pin(17))
   vfs = os.VfsFat(sd)
   os.mount(vfs, "/sd")

   # Function to update display and log data
   def update_display_and_log():
       dht_sensor.measure()
       temp = dht_sensor.temperature()
       humidity = dht_sensor.humidity()

       # Update the OLED display
       oled.fill(0)
       oled.text("Temp: {} C".format(temp), 0, 0)
       oled.text("Humidity: {}%".format(humidity), 0, 10)
       oled.show()

       # Log data to SD card
       with open("/sd/data_log.txt", "a") as f:
           f.write("{},{},{}\n".format(rtc.datetime(), temp, humidity))

   # Main loop
   while True:
       update_display_and_log()
       utime.sleep(1)
   ```

### Step 4: Testing and Calibration
- **Testing:** Ensure all components work together as expected. Test the display updates, sensor accuracy, and data logging functionality.
- **Calibration:** Calibrate sensors if necessary, especially the DHT22 for temperature and humidity.

### Step 5: Final Assembly
- Secure all components, ensuring they are protected and properly mounted for use in paragliding. Consider weatherproofing since these devices will be exposed to outdoor elements.

This setup will provide you with a robust variometer system that not only tracks altitude changes with auditory feedback but also provides crucial environmental data and logs all information for further analysis or record keeping.
